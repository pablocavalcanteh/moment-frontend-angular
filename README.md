# MOMENTS

Application for sharing moments built up in Angular.

## How does it work?

Download the project to your local machine. So, install all dependencies that way:

```
npm install
```

After, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

This application needs a backend application to work. So, you guys can build up with whatever technologies you want.

So, that's it guys!
